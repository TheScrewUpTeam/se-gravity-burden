# 🌍 Burden of Gravity
### Realistic Thrusters & Batteries Rebalance  
*Mass has meaning. Lift has limits. Welcome to real engineering.*

---

**Burden of Gravity** is a gameplay rebalance mod for *Space Engineers*, focused on **atmospheric thrusters** and **batteries**.

It makes flying heavy vehicles on planets far more realistic—without breaking compatibility or requiring new blocks.

No more floating factories. No more anti-gravity bricks. Just honest engineering.
